    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does “Intelligence” Mean in Card Systems?</h2>
      <p>
        In the context of credit cards, “intelligence” usually refers to the data and decision engines that sit
        behind the plastic (or virtual) card. They help issuers decide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who gets approved</strong> and at what credit limit</li>
        <li><strong>Which transactions are allowed</strong> in real time</li>
        <li><strong>When to raise flags</strong> for fraud or unusual activity</li>
        <li><strong>How offers and rewards</strong> are personalized over time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is done with combinations of rule-based logic, traditional statistics and newer machine-learning models,
        all fed by large amounts of transaction and behavioural data.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Scoring & Models -->
    <section id="models" class="section">
      <h2>Credit Scores, Internal Scores &amp; Risk Models</h2>

      <h3>1. External credit scores</h3>
      <p>
        Many issuers start with external bureau scores – numeric summaries of your credit history. These scores
        are often used as one parameter among many in an internal decision engine.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Internal risk scoring</h3>
      <p>
        Issuers typically maintain their own scoring systems that estimate:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>probability of default or late payment</li>
        <li>likelihood of heavy revolver vs. transactor behaviour</li>
        <li>expected long-term profitability or loss</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These internal scores may be updated frequently as new data flows in: payments, utilisation levels,
        income updates and early signs of stress.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Machine learning and pattern recognition</h3>
      <p>
        Modern systems often apply machine learning to detect combinations of factors that are hard to capture
        with simple rules. This can improve risk discrimination, but also raises questions about fairness,
        explainability and regulatory oversight.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Monitoring & Fraud -->
    <section id="monitoring" class="section">
      <h2>Real-Time Monitoring, Fraud &amp; Behaviour Signals</h2>
      <p>
        Transaction monitoring engines look at every authorisation request in milliseconds, asking questions like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Is the location or merchant unusual for this cardholder?</li>
        <li>Does the amount or pattern resemble known fraud scenarios?</li>
        <li>Has the card just been used in two far-away places within minutes?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Based on this, the system may:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>approve normally</li>
        <li>approve but trigger an extra check (e.g. app notification or SMS)</li>
        <li>decline and flag the transaction for review</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The same data can drive “soft” intelligence: recommending limit increases, offering instalment plans on
        large purchases or adjusting rewards to encourage specific behaviours.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Implications -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Implications for Cardholders</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding that “intelligence” is constantly evaluating your account can help explain why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>applications are sometimes declined even with “good” credit scores</li>
        <li>limits may move up or down based on usage and risk signals</li>
        <li>unusual but legitimate trips can trigger security checks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It also highlights why transparency and regulation around data usage, fairness and model bias matter in
        consumer credit – especially when automated decisions have real-life consequences.
